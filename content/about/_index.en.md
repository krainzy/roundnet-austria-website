# The Idea

Roundnet Austria is a Project or rather an **idea**. There are few distinct facts but a common spirit of Austrians who engange in Roudnnet and work towards a common goal.

# The Goal

Roundnet Austria exists to foster and develeop the sport of Roundnet in Austria. The goal is to spread the Sport to the general public.

# The Organization (Fachverband)

To provide additional transparency and structure for this goal, Roundnet Austria is going to get **official** / **legal** structures by founding of an organization (Fachverband). This is especially beneficial in regards to state subsidies.

# The Plan

All, who want to contribute to this project, have some ideas or just want to keep informed are more than welcome to do this:
